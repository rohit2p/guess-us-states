U.S. States Game

**
Introduction**

The U.S. States Game is a simple Python script using the Turtle graphics library and Pandas for data handling. The game quizzes the user to name U.S. states interactively and displays them on a map.

Setup

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
Install the required libraries using pip install turtle pandas.
Run the Python script in a compatible environment.


**Game Rules
**

The game displays an outline map of the U.S. states.
The user is prompted to input the names of U.S. states.
The game continues until the user correctly guesses all 50 states or types "Exit" to end the game.
After the game ends, a list of the states not guessed correctly is displayed.


**Usage**

Input the name of a U.S. state when prompted.
Type "Exit" to end the game at any time.

**Customization**

Map Image: You can replace the map image by providing the path to a different image file.
Data: The script uses a CSV file ("50_states.csv") to get the names and coordinates of U.S. states. You can modify this file or use a different dataset.

**Additional Information
**

The game uses Turtle graphics for visualization and Pandas for handling state data.
Coordinates for state names are obtained from the dataset and displayed on the map.
The game encourages interactive learning about the geography of U.S. states.
